- **Calendar:** Checks the day of the week for a given date.
- **Sound Alerts:** Plays sounds using `playsound`.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Uses `Tkinter` for a basic user interface.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Utilizes `spacy` for NLP tasks.
- **Web Requests:** Makes HTTP requests using `requests` for potential integrations.
